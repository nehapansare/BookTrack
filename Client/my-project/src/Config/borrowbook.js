      description: `The Great Gatsby is set in the summer of 1922 and revolves around the mysterious figure of Jay Gatsby, a wealthy man who lives in a lavish mansion on Long Island. 
  
  The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, a young man from Minnesota who moves to West Egg, a wealthy area of Long Island, to work in the bond business. Nick rents a modest house next to Gatsby’s mansion and soon becomes intrigued by his enigmatic neighbor.
  
  Gatsby is known for throwing extravagant parties every weekend, where people from all walks of life gather to drink, dance, and indulge in excess. Despite his fame, Gatsby remains a mystery to most of the guests at his parties. Nick learns that Gatsby is in love with Daisy Buchanan, Nick’s cousin, who lives in East Egg, a neighboring area inhabited by old-moneyed families. Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan, a wealthy, arrogant, and unfaithful man.
  
  Nick becomes closer to Daisy and Tom, and eventually learns of Gatsby's past. Gatsby and Daisy had a romantic relationship years earlier, but Daisy married Tom while Gatsby went off to fight in World War I. Gatsby, who made his fortune through dubious means, has spent the years since the war trying to win Daisy back. He believes that he can recreate the past they once had, and he convinces Daisy to leave Tom and be with him again.
  
  However, things do not go as Gatsby hopes. Daisy, torn between her past with Gatsby and her present life with Tom, is unable to choose. Tom, aware of Gatsby’s intentions, confronts him and exposes Gatsby’s background to Daisy, who ultimately chooses to stay with Tom.
  
  The situation leads to tragedy when Daisy accidentally runs over Tom's mistress, Myrtle Wilson, with Gatsby’s car. Myrtle’s husband, George Wilson, believes Gatsby was driving the car and, thinking Gatsby was responsible for Myrtle’s death, kills him.
  
  Nick, devastated by the turn of events, arranges Gatsby’s funeral, but no one from Gatsby’s parties or his acquaintances attends. The novel ends with Nick reflecting on the empty pursuit of the American Dream and the illusion of success. Nick returns to Minnesota, disillusioned by the lives of the wealthy and the moral decay that underpins their lives.
  
  The Great Gatsby explores themes of ambition, love, wealth, and the corruption of the American Dream. It is a critical examination of the excesses of the Jazz Age and a story of unattainable dreams, where the pursuit of happiness leads to destruction. Through the tragic story of Gatsby, Fitzgerald paints a picture of a society that is morally bankrupt and disconnected from reality, despite its outward appearance of wealth and success.`
